Assignment 1 - AngularJS Report to Management
=============================================

Goal
----

This assignment is designed to test your ability to go out and do research
new technologies. By itself, this isn't useful unless you can communicate
those findings to management. With Assignment 1 you need to do both.

Your bosses at Fine Iowa Car Loans (FICL)
have heard a lot about this new "AngularJS_" toolkit. But your
company doesn't yet have anything to do with it. Should they?
It is your job to find out.

Write a report to your technology managers on AngularJS. The report should
provide a factual, balanced view of the technology.

Include the following in your report:

* Report title, date, version, author - Make sure the managers know who wrote
  the report, when, and what version of the report they are looking at. (As
  things often get updated.)
* Executive summary paragraph - Write this last. Give a quick one-paragraph
  summary of what you came up with.
* What is AngularJS?
* What does AngularJS do?
* History of AngularJS. Who wrote it, how long has it been around, etc.
* Opportunities for using AngularJS. What could the company use AngularJS for?
* Risks in using AngularJS. Is it too new? Outdated? Subject to change? No
  vendor to stand behind it?
* Performance considerations with AngularJS? Does it run fast? Does it take
  a long time to download?
* Scalability of using AngularJS. If we have 1,000 people on our web server,
  will this help or hurt us?
* What support is out their for Angular JS? If something goes wrong, who will
  we get support from?
* Popularity: Can we find AngularJS programmers? Is it a fad? Is it getting old
  and out of date?
* Your conclusions on AngularJS.
* References (Where did you get your info? Back it your information with
  citations from reputable publications.)

When you are done, check the following:

* Make sure that you use paragraphs. No one will read long walls of text.
  Follow the PIE_ methodology for paragraphs.
* Bullet lists, numbered lists, these are ok to use. Write for a technical
  manager that wants to be able to skim the report.

Note that in two weeks you'll write a different report. The next report will not
be to your managers, but to other programmers.
