Assignment 2 - AngularJS Proof-of-Concept
=========================================

Goal
----

See if you can download, install, and follow tutorials on how to get a new
technology working at a proof-of-concept level.


Details
-------

Create a proof-of-concept on how to use AngularJS_. Theme it using our Fine
Iowa Car Loans company. Show how to get something useful working for our
car loan company.

There are tutorials out there you can find. W3Schools has a nice one.
They also have a JavaScript tutorial if you haven't learned JavaScript yet,
or are a bit rusty.

For this tutorial, you may copy/paste material from the web. However to not
count as plagiarism you must cite where you got information from. Include
the citation in comments before the code. Like::

	// The following code was adapted from the W3Schools AngularJS example at:
	// http://www.w3schools.com/angular/angular_expressions.asp

Zip up the files and upload,
or link to the proof of concept on GitHub_, JSBin_, or Gist_.

Next week you will create your own tutorial stepping through how to create
an AngularJS application.
