=======================================

Goal
----

See if you can download, install, and follow tutorials on how to get a new
technology working at a proof-of-concept level.


Details
-------

Create a proof-of-concept on how to use NodeJS_. Theme it using our Fine
Iowa Car Loans company. Show how to get something useful working for our
car loan company.

There are tutorials out there you can find. `TutorialsPoint Node.js`_ tutorial is
good.

For this tutorial, you may copy/paste material from the web. **However**
to not count as plagiarism you must cite where you got information from.
Include the citation in comments before the code. Like::

    // The following code was adapted from the TutorialsPoint example at:
    // https://www.tutorialspoint.com/nodejs/

Zip up the files and upload, or link to the proof of concept on GitHub_.

Next week you will create your own tutorial stepping through how to create
a Node.js application.
