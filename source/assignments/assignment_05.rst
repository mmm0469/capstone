===================================

-------

In this assignment, you will create an relational schema diagram for a database
that will store academic information for a college.

* Have a common table to track people
* Track which people are students
* Track which people are instructors
* Track which people are alumni
* Track classes (Like CMSC 150, not ties to a particular time)
* Track class sections (A particular section of a class, like CMSC 150 A for Fall 2018)
* Track class section registrations
* Track who is in what section, with what room, and who teaches
* Track grades
* Track rooms (what classes are taught in what rooms)
* Track semesters (just fall and spring)

Make sure you identify:

* Tables
* Fields in the table
* Data types
* Primary keys
* Foreign keys
* Relationships (One-to-one, zero-too-many-to-one, etc.)

Turn in the diagram. If you are drawing by hand, upload a photo of the
drawing. Make sure it is neat enough I can read it.
