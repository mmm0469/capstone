Assignment 8 - Data Structures 1
================================

Assignment
----------

For each program below:

* Explain what the program does
* Explain the results of the program
* Try to explain why the results are what they are. If you don't know for
  certain, create a hypothesis.
* This has a lot to do with data structures. Make sure your explanation does
  dive into the particulars of the data structures and what is happening. Don't
  give a "surface" explanation, make sure you understand. Ask me questions if
  needed or check to make sure your are in the right ballpark. This assignment
  is the easiest to get a bad grade on if you don't check to make sure.
