Assignment 10 - Database Diagramming 2
======================================

Goal
----

Demonstrate your proficiency in diagramming a relational schema for a database.

Details
-------

In this assignment, you will create an relational schema diagram for a database
that will store grading information for classes.

* Have a common table to track people
* Track which classes there are (e.g. CMSC 150)
* Track semesters there are (Summer, Fall, Spring)
* Track academic years (for example 14-15 would containg 14/SU, 14/FA and 15/SP)
* Track which class sections there are (For example 15/SP CMSC 150 Section A)
* Track enrollments

	* Track which people are students
	* Track which people are instructors

* Allow students to re-take a class and still keep separate the scores.
* Track assignments
* Track assignment submissions by students

  * Keep an assignment submission history. So if a student submits on Friday,
    then resubmits the assignment on Monday, you can track that history.

* Track grades on assignments

Make sure you identify:

* Tables
* Fields in the table
* Data types
* Primary keys
* Foreign keys
* Relationships (One-to-one, zero-too-many-to-one, etc.)

Turn in the diagram. If you are drawing by hand, upload a photo of the
drawing. Make sure it is neat enough I can read it.
