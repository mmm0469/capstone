Assignment 13 - Final Project
=============================

Goal
----

This is your final project for the capstone. This assignment is worth twice
the points as the other assignments. There is also a rough-draft turn-in
part way through.

Details
-------

For the final project, pick your own subject to research. The research must
involve learning something new-to-you, and include a component where you
create some sample code.

Some possible things to learn about:

* [D3](https://d3js.org/) Graph Library for JavaScript
* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) UI library for JavaScript
* [Phaser.io](http://phaser.io/) Game library for JavaScript
* [libgdx](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) Game library for Java
* [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/)Programming language
* [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) Using the Arduino
* UNIX command line tools, including grep, sed, and awk
* [Powershell](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/mt173057.aspx) Microsoft scripting language

This is a pretty open research paper. Please feel free to drop me a note
to double-check that a subject would be good.

Grading
-------

* Introduction (30% of the grade)

	* Describe what the topic is.
	* Describe how it could be used.
	* Reflect on how you could use it personally.

* Demonstration (60% of the grade)

	* Show what you were able to create. Screen shots are encouraged. (Use the
	  Windows "Snipping Tool", Snag-It, or similar.)
    * Show actual code that you've written.

* Conclusion (10% of the grade)

	* Where do you see this technology going? Is it useful?

* Rough draft is due Monday April 17 at 8 am.
* Final copy is due Thursday April 22nd at 5 pm.

The draft is not graded, but the
feedback will help you get a good grade for your final copy.
