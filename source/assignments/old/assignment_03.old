==================================================

Goal
----

In assignment 1, we had you writing at a high-level to your technical managers.
Now the goal is to write a lower level explanation to your fellow programmers.


Details
-------

Take the proof-of-concept that you created, and make a tutorial based off it.

* Use the "Snip" tool, the Alt-Print-screen combination, or some other tool to
  make screen shots.
* During the tutorial, explain concepts like templates, components, file and
  directory organization, and data binding.
